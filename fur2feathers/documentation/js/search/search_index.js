It is a form of property insurance and works similarly to an auto or home insurance policy. Pet insurance is most often set up so that you pay your veterinarian up-front and are reimbursed a percentage of the bill after you have met your annual deductible. \n                \n            \n\n            \n            Why do I need pet insurance? \n            \n                \n                    Veterinary care is expensive. In 2018 Americans spent $72 billion dollars on their pets, $18.11 billion specifically on veterinary care. This amount is increasing at approximately 6.1% per year. While every pet parent would love to say that money is no object when it comes to the health of their furry, scaley, or feathered family member, it is the sad truth that many Americans simply cannot afford extended care for pet illness or the unexpected expenses of emergency care. Sometimes it means saying no to needed diagnostic tests or in extreme cases, losing a beloved family member due to financial constraints.

Not all pre-existing condition exclusions are permanent. If you have medical records from your veterinarian showing that your pet's condition has been cured for at least 6 months, you may be able to get it covered. Other pre-existing conditions are not curable and will be permanently excluded from coverage.\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Q: How can I retrieve my Nationwide Pet Account Access page Login ID or password?\n                \n                    A: To retrieve your login ID or password, visit the Contact Us page and enter your contact information and the information of one of the pets on your policy in the appropriate fields.

In that case, you will only be reimbursed for the policy limit.\n                    For preventative care claims, your policy will only cover any expenses if you are in the same state as your address on file.

Your plan may be accompanied by an annual or per-incident deductible.\n                    \n                    Per-incident deductibles are applied on all of our plans. This deductible applies to each unrelated accident or illness per policy term. Only one deductible applied when submitting multiple claims for the same accident or illness. For example, if your pet has an ear infection and requires follow-up visits, only one deductible applies because it is related to the same incident.  \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Q: How to file a claim\n                \n                A: Submit a claim with these simple steps: 1.

You will be refunded as per your plan (deductible), once the claim gets processed in 3-10 days.\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Q: Deceased Pet\n                \n                We understand how difficult it is to lose your fur/feather baby.

A: The Accident/Illness and Preventative Care Plan                     excludes items such as grooming, tax, waste disposal                    , boarding, or pre-existing conditions. See policy documents for a complete list of exclusions.                                                        Q: What is considered a pre-existing condition?                                    A: A pre-existing condition is any condition that                     began or was treated before the effective date of                     your policy, whether or not the condition was                      discovered, diagnosed or treated. Not all pre-existing condition exclusions are permanent. If you have medical records from your veterinarian showing that your pet\\'s condition has been cured for at least 6 months, you may be able to get it covered. Other pre-existing conditions are not curable and will be permanently excluded from coverage.

Q: Does my pet’s policy still apply if I am traveling to another city, state or country?                                    A: For accident/illness claims, your policy will still cover any veterinarian expenses even if you are in a different state or country as long as the cost does not exceed the policy limits. In that case, you will only be reimbursed for the policy limit.                    For preventative care claims, your policy will only cover any expenses if you are in the same state as your address on file. Any claims submitted from a different state or country will not be covered. If you are moving, please call us at 888-555-1234 to notify us of the address change to verify that your policy will cover your pets.                                                                        Q: How does my deductible work?                                    A: Your deductible is the amount of covered veterinary service expenses that you agree to pay during your policy term before your insurance benefits kick in. Your plan may be accompanied by an annual or per-incident deductible.                                        Per-incident deductibles are applied on all of our plans. This deductible applies to each unrelated accident or illness per policy term. Only one deductible applied when submitting multiple claims for the same accident or illness. For example, if your pet has an ear infection and requires follow-up visits, only one deductible applies because it is related to the same incident.                                                                          Q: How to file a claim                                A: Submit a claim with these simple steps: 1. Go to the website and login to access your pet profile 2. After selecting the pet profile, upload a picture to submit a vet bill for that particular pet 3. You will be refunded as per your plan (deductible), once the claim gets processed in 3-10 days.
