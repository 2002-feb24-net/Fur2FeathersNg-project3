            <label>How pet insurance works.</label>
            <div class="guide-content">
                <p>
                    Pet insurance is a way to prepare for expected and unexpected veterinary costs. It is a form of property insurance and works similarly to an auto or home insurance policy. Pet insurance is most often set up so that you pay your veterinarian up-front and are reimbursed a percentage of the bill after you have met your annual deductible.

            <label>Why do I need pet insurance?</label> 
            <div class="guide-content">
                <p>
                    Veterinary care is expensive. In 2018 Americans spent $72 billion dollars on their pets, $18.11 billion specifically on veterinary care. This amount is increasing at approximately 6.1% per year. While every pet parent would love to say that money is no object when it comes to the health of their furry, scaley, or feathered family member, it is the sad truth that many Americans simply cannot afford extended care for pet illness or the unexpected expenses of emergency care. Sometimes it means saying no to needed diagnostic tests or in extreme cases, losing a beloved family member due to financial constraints. Pet insurance is a way to prepare for the unexpected.
